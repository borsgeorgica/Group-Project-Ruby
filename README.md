## Team 23
**Spicy Slice**

## Introduction

Welcome to Spicy Slice's GitHub page, we have come up with a new idea of allowing users to purchase Pizza's through twitter directly! All they have to do is tweet and their order is up getting ready. 
Team 23 consists of 7 members who worked really hard to bring this project to you using Ruby with Sinatra and Thin along with other gems for databases. 

## Code Example

Our code consists of a main ruby file which runs the website. The code is user friendly UI with a client panel and a Admin panel to make it easy to process the orders for both Admins and Customers. 
The Views folder has all files which build up the user interface.
The Public folder has files which are required by other files such as the CSS, Images etc. 

## Installation

Simply install the gemfiles using the command "Bundle install" which will install all the gems. After that you need to run the "main.rb" file and open 'localhost:4567' to access the website

## Twitter API

Throughout the code we have used the twitter gem and the twitter API to make it easy for the admins to take control of the twitter orders from the website itself!

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
